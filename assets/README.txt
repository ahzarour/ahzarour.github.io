Add a photo named `nature.jpg` in this folder and it will be used as the page background.

Recommended:
- Use a high-resolution landscape image (e.g., 2560x1440 or larger).
- Darker images work best with glassmorphism; the CSS adds a subtle dark blue overlay for readability.
- If you use a different name, update the path in `World-Clock-Style.css` under the `body, html` background-image.
